## Playing with Data Part 01 ( Start with Array )

    - In PHP, there are three types of arrays:
        1. - Indexed arrays - Arrays with a numeric index
        2. - Associative arrays - Arrays with named keys
        3. - Multidimensional arrays - Arrays containing one or more arrays

### Indexed arrays

    - In indexed arrays each item has an index number.
    - By default, the first item has index 0, the second item has item 1, etc.
